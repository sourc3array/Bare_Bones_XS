# WHAT IS CONVOLUTION?

In oversimplified terms, convolution is used to make one thing sound like something else. This is done by capturing the sonic fingerprint (typically reverb) of a specific sound source (like a location) in an impulse response (IR). This IR can then be used as a sonic infusion of sorts, lending any target sound the acoustic signature of the source sound as defined by its IR profile. 

The sound source used for IRs can be anything: a physical space, 80s reverb unit, analog tape machine, vintage guitar cabinet, broken microphone, symphony of purring cats, etc. Though typically used to model reverbs and simulate guitar cabinets, the ability to morph any sound onto another offers unlimited potential for creative sound explorers.


# USING CONVOLUTION

**Bare Bones XS** includes ten (10) IR files for use with the Convolution Reverb effect built into the *Decent Sampler* engine. These IR profiles are utilized by the *Alien Armpit* virtual instrument preset and can be accesed using the included menu option for the reverb effect.

To use additional IR files, simply add them to the 'IRs' folder and update the 'Alien Armpit.dspreset' file accordingly using a text editor.
