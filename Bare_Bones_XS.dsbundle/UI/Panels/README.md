# What Are Panels?

Panels are image files used by the Decent Sampler engine to create the user interface (UI) backgrounds for each of the **Bare Bones XS** instrument presets.

 - The Decent Sampler platform supports custom background images in PNG format.
 
# Using Panels

**Bare Bones XS** includes three (3) original panel designs intended for use as backgrounds in your custom Decent Sampler instrument presets. Panels feature a vintage equipment theme in a variety of brushed-metallic colors. Panels are intentionally blank, thereby maximizing their versatility by enabling any conceivable UI layout or design.

Panels can be customized using an image editor. To use a custom image as an instrument preset background, simply add the image file to the 'Panels' folder and update your instument preset file(s) accordingly using a text editor.
