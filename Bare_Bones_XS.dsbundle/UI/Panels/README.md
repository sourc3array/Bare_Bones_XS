# WHAT ARE PANELS?

Panels are image files used by the *Decent Sampler* engine to create the interface background for virtual instrument presets.


# USING PANELS

**Bare Bones XS** includes three (3) original panel designs for use with the *Decent Sampler* engine. Panels feature a vintage equipment theme in a variety of brushed-metallic colors and are intentionally blank to maximize customization potential.

Panels can be customized using an image editor. To use any custom image as an instrument background, simply add the file to the 'Panels' folder and update the instument preset file accordingly using a text editor.
