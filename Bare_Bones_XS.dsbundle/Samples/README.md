# WHAT ARE SAMPLES?

The 'Samples' folder contains the collection of sound files used by the *Decent Sampler* engine to create the signature sound of the *GEN Synth Bass* across all of the **Bare Bones XS** virtual instrument presets.


# USING SAMPLES

**Bare Bones XS** includes sounds for one note and one sustained note, each sampled with varying levels of saturation. These samples are used for creating multiple velocity layers where louder hits trigger increasingly agressive sounds.

Also included are sample sets for a glitch noise and a sustained glitch noise, each sampled with random variations to enable up to five (5) layers of round-robin randomness for each key.

To use custom sound files to create an original instrument, simply add the files to the 'Samples' folder and update the instument preset file accordingly using a text editor.
