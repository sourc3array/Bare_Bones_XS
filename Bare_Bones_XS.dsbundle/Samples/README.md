# What Are Samples?

**Samples** are the sound files used by the *Decent Sampler* engine to create the sonic foundation for a virtual instrument. Collectively, the sound files in the 'Samples' folder comprise the *sound bank* for the instrument as a whole. The **Bare Bones XS** sound bank is what gives the *GEN Synth Bass* its signature sound across all of its instrument presets.

 - The Decent Sampler platform supports mono (untested) or stereo sample files in WAV or AIFF format.


# Using Samples

The **Bare Bones XS** sound bank includes *GEN Synth Bass* samples for one note and one sustained note. Each note has been sampled at pitch C5 across a range of saturation levels. This enables the creation of multiple velocity layers, where louder hits trigger increasingly agressive sounds.

Also included are sample sets for a glitch and a sustained glitch, each sampled at pitch C5 with random variations to enable up to five (5) unique glitch sounds when used in a round-robin rotation.

To use custom samples to create an original instrument, simply add the sound files to the 'Samples' folder and update your instument preset file(s) accordingly using a text editor.
