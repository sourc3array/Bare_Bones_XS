# Bare Bones XS

![example workflow](https://github.com/sourc3array/Bare_Bones_XS/actions/workflows/basic_workflow.yml/badge.svg)

**Bare Bones XS** is a full-featured UI kit and template pack for [Decent Sampler]( https://www.decentsamples.com/product/decent-sampler-plugin/ ) that enables users to build 100% custom virtual instruments.

 - The **starter template** shows users how to quickly and easily create a fully-functional Decent Sampler instrument using only one sound sample and a text editor.
 - Customize your sound with **effects** including high- and low-pass filters, reverb, chorus, convoltion and distortion.
 - Build **production-level instruments** with multiple sound groups, velocity layers, round-robins and MIDI command controllers (CCs). 

The UI kit includes all of the [knobs]( /Bare_Bones_XS.dsbundle/UI/Controls/ ), [switches]( /Bare_Bones_XS.dsbundle/UI/Buttons/ ) and [panel backgrounds]( /Bare_Bones_XS.dsbundle/UI/Panels/ ) needed to create custom user interface (UI) designs for your Decent Sampler instrument presets. Also included are 10 [impulse response (IR) files]( /Bare_Bones_XS.dsbundle/IRs/ ) for use with the convolution effect.
